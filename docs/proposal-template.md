# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

An intuitive, modern, easy-to-use all-in-one fitness web application. 
We plan to have processes that encompass the majority of what is used commonly in all fitness applications. 
This includes calorie/macro tracking and viewing/modifying a user's workout routine.
We emphasize the intuitiveness of the UI design - as this is a problem that is common across all fitness applications.
This will allow us to encourage new users (and beginners to fitness) to utilize our application without unnecessary visual clutter that leads to confusion and ultimately, discouragement within their fitness journey.

- Includes the ability to track calories and macros on a day-to-day basis. 
- Data visualization plots will also be included to showcase changes on a day-to-day, weekly, or monthly basis. 
- Utilization of an API to gather food nutrition data through a database will allow for user's to input daily consumption of food. 
- Storing user data will allow us to create graphical plots to showcase these changes in a clean, easy to interpret manner. 
- Additionally, the conversion of an uploaded PDF/Excel file allows the user to view and modify their workout routine in a generalized template.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)
- React
- Some sort of component library
- Postman (for API calls when we don't have our UI ready yet)
- Tableau? (Not sure, listed this as a potential data viz program to use since it's free to GVSU students)
- Figma (UI/UX design for the project)

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
- Get familiar with necessary technologies
- Plan out UI/UX design and ensure we have a template to refer to when developing/writing code
- We should assign cards/tickets that aren't too big, with detailed instructions on what we want exactly to ensure we are moving at a manageable, yet incrementing state

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)
- I anticipate that the UI design shouldnt take too long - around possibly 2-3 weeks
- The majority of our time will most likely be focused on interaction/integration of APIs and conversion of PDF/Excel sheets - could take upwards to 4-6 weeks

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
- Getting used to organizing each other's code and building off their work
- Integration of various technologies and languages we will be using

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
