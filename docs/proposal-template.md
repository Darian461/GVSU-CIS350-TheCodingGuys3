# Abstract

Health and fitness is a critical aspect in everyone's life. In today's technology driven era, a plethora of knowledge and accessibility to tools regarding our diet and exercise
are available to us through the internet. However, starting your health and fitness journey is a cumbersome task - especially when stonewalled by an overwhelming number
of applications and resources. On top of that, fitness applications meant for accessibility and ease-of-use are often bulky and filled with jargon and visual clutter that scare
away new users and beginners. Our goal is to create an application that remedies this issue - offering a fluid, easy-to-use, and accessible UI that is complete with the essential
functionalities of health and fitness applications such as food logging, exercise programming, and data visualizations of our journey.

# Introduction

An intuitive, modern, easy-to-use all-in-one fitness web application that includes the ability to track calories, upload or create exercise programs, and data visualizations of the
user's progress. We emphasize the intuitiveness and cleanliness of the UI - where we plan to design an interface that is clear of visual clutter and navigation is quick and easy
to use. Accessibility for all users is also a goal, where exercise examples and jargon is explained in a simple, easy-to-follow manner.
We plan to have processes that encompass the majority of what is used commonly in all fitness applications.
